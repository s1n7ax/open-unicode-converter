I wanted to create a Unicode converter that is truly free, opensource and most importantly, Configurable. First I went through some of the applications I found on the internet. 

Their Disadvantages:
* None of these are FOSS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
* None of these are configurable
* QSfox - This used to be the best Sinhala Unicode Converter back then but no longer works or available for download
* Real Time Unicode Converter - editing is hard because the converted text is in another text area. Unable to include some English characters in the Sinhala text.
* Helakuru - Not really a good online Unicode converter. No help page. No good use of space on the website. It's just for showcasing the capabilities.
* Google Input Tools - Awesome, but I prefer just typing what I want instead of selecting whatever the word google is suggesting to me. If you happened to write official documents, I highly recommend Input tool over anything, but I'm not that guy. 

So I came up with "Open Unicode Converter" solution, with a configurable and extensible (for other languages) FOSS implementation along with "Sinhala Unicode Converter" implementation and a simple web UI to showcase the capabilities.

Features:
* You are free to update or change anything (FOSS).
* If you just want to change a letter, you don't need any programming knowledge. 
* I have included Test Cases for every single conversion to Sinhala Unicode. 
* Well commented and Readable code
* Really good use of space
* Now you can have English and Sinhala in the same document and keyboard short cut to change the language.(Ctrl + Space)
